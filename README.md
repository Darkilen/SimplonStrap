# ------ Grid
# 12-columns-type grid, with various fractionned column sizes
# container class: .grid
# column dimensions: w-dividend-divider
# Exemples:
# 1 twelth column = w-1-12 = one-twelve
# 1 tier column = w-1-3 = w-4-12 = four-twelve
# 50% column = w-1-2 = w-2-4 = w-3-6 = w-6-12 = six-twelve
# For personalize your own grids, my advice is to use their greatest common divisor class names
# If you want to make a grid with a 7/12 and a 5/12 size columns, you should put 'w-7-12' and 'w-5-12' columns
# If you just want one separate in 1 tier and 2 tiers size columns, you may use 'w-1-3' and 'w-2-3'
